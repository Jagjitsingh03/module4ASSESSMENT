# Degen Gaming Token

# Overview
The Degen Gaming Token is an ERC20 token deployed on the Avalanche network.
This token is designed to be used within the Degen Gaming platform, enabling functionalities 
such as minting new tokens, transferring tokens between players, redeeming tokens for in-game items, checking token balances, and burning tokens.

# Description
The Degen Gaming Token is a custom ERC20 token with additional functionalities to support the gaming ecosystem. The token contract allows the platform 
owner to mint new tokens as rewards for players, facilitates token transfers between players, and enables players to redeem tokens for in-game items.
Players can also check their token balances and burn tokens they no longer need. The contract leverages OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and Ownable contracts for security and ease of implementation.

# Help
For common issues, ensure:

You have the correct Avalanche network configuration in your hardhat.config.js.
You have sufficient AVAX to pay for deployment gas fees.
